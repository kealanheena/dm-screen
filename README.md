### GM Screen
I wanted to create an app that allows me to collect all the important information for a D&D game and have it easily accessed from one place.


Potential feature:
- Tabs with quick access infomation
   - number of default options
   - maybe a split screen for the tabs
- combat tracker
   - shareable tracker (webhooks)
       - User notifications/popup when its their turn
   - Stat block access with quick info access
   - Drop down for applying Conditions
       - Pop up for Concentration check
- Random number generator, no dice
- images with clickable sections that popup with room details
